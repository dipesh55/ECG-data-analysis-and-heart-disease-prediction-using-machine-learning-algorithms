ECG Classification Using Various Machine Learning Techniques

Electrocardiography (EKG or ECG) is the medical process for recording the electrical
action of the human heart for a certain period of time. An electrocardiogram is a noninvasive,
painless test. Body cells in humans behave like little batteries. These cells have different ion
concentrations inside and outside of their membranes which create small electric potentials
called bio potentials. Here, we propose an effective electrocardiogram (ECG) arrhythmia
classification method using a deep two-dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN)
which recently shows outstanding performance in the field of pattern recognition. Every
ECG beat was transformed into a two dimensional gray scale image as an input data for
the CNN classifier. Optimization of the proposed CNN classifier includes various deep
learning techniques such as batch normalization, data augmentation, Xavier initialization,
and dropout. In addition, we compared our proposed classifier with two well known CNN
models; AlexNet and VGGNet. Again, using different Algorithm for classification using Knearest
Neighbors(KNN) which recently shows outstanding performance in the field of
pattern recognition. E classifier. Optimization of the The KNN algorithm assumes that
similar things exist in close proximity. In addition, we compared our proposed classifier
with two well known PCA models; SVM and KNN. ECG recordings from the MITBIH
arrhythmia database were used for the evaluation of the classifier. As a result, our classifier
achieved 99.05 average accuracy with 97.85 average sensitivity. Our experimental results
have successfully validated that the proposed differenrt Machine Learning classifier with
the transformed ECG images can achieve excellent classification accuracy without any
manual pre-processing of the ECG signals such as noise filtering, feature extraction, and
feature reduction.
